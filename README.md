# A* Pathfinder APP

-> I have been playing with canvas, p5.js and reading about this searching algorithm for last couple of days and came up with this interesting pathfinder app.
-> I have implemented A* star search algorithm that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost

Features:
-> This javascript app generates a maze of set of certain obstacles in which this app finds a shortest way from source to destination.
-> You can change as much mazes as you can by clicking on Maze Change Button
-> Step by Step Button gives you the functionality to see how the algorithm found the path step by step from destination to source.
